# flight_recording_system
A simple system programmed in C that records different flights at an airport

The files were mostly coded by myself and demonstrate knowledge of simple algorithms using tree structures. The files are only part of a larger code base
so the files will not compile or function. The code just serves as demonstration of my knowledge for future employers.
